# Kiri

Kiri is gotten from the Igbo word "Ihe nkiri" which could be interpreted to mean movie. It is an app that works with TMDB(The movie database)'s API.

Kiri is a sample app project used during a presentation on building android apps at Google Developer Group Landmark University. The branches show different 'phases' and reflect the transitions and additions over previous branches. 

# How to use
Download or clone Kiri. Get an api key from TMDB's developer website. Enter your api key in the strings folder under the item tag that has the id "api_key". Compile and run.
