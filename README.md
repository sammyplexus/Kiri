# Kiri

Kiri is gotten from the Igbo word "Ihe nkiri" which could be interpreted to mean movie. It is an app that works with TMDB(The movie database)'s API.

Kiri is a sample app project used during a presentation on building android apps at Google Developer Group Landmark University. The branches show different 'phases' and reflect the transitions and additions over previous branches.
